![p4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55f3c6cc-e6b9-4efb-8e60-5d8e913d6c1b)

## Overview
The Satellite Landscape Classification System (SLCS) leverages the MobileNetV2 architecture to classify satellite images into distinct landscape categories. This project aims to provide an efficient and accurate solution for remote sensing and environmental monitoring applications.


## Features
- Utilizes MobileNetV2, a lightweight deep learning model.
- Classifies satellite images into four categories: `cloudy`, `desert`, `green_area`, `water`.
- Data augmentation for enhanced model robustness.
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python 3.x and the necessary libraries installed.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/satellite_landscape_classification.git](https://github.com/iguptashubham/satellite_landscape_classifier_system.git)
    cd satellite_landscape_classification
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

3. prediction
add your image path
```sh
    run predict.py
    ```
